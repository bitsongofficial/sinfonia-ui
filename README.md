A frontend Vue app to manage BitSong Fan tokens pools on the Osmosis AMM.

In particular, a user can:

- Look at each Fan token market info
- Have an overview of all his BitSong related assets
- Swap between Fan tokens or between BTSG and Fan tokens
- See an history of his swapping transactions
- Take advantage of both monthly and transaction based reward systems
