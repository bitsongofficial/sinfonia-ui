### Reporting Bugs :bug: 

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Sinfonia. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer:, and find related reports (when exists) :mag_right:.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report :ballot_box_with_check: 

* **Check if you can reproduce** the problem in the **latest version** of Sinfonia.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+repo%3Abitsongofficial%2Fsinfonia-ui)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue which seems to describe your issue, open a new one and reference the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How to submit a Bug Report? :incoming_envelope: 

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on this repository and provide the needed information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/bitsongofficial/sinfonia-ui/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=BUG-REPORT.yml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+) (if it is to join the "bugs competition", click [here](https://github.com/bitsongofficial/sinfonia-ui/issues/new?assignees=angelorc%2CDavideSegullo%2CGiorgionocera&labels=bug%2Ccompetition+bug+report&template=BUG-COMPETITION-REPORT.yml&title=%5BCompetition+Bug%5D%3A+)).

You have to completely explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Choose a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the related problem.
* **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you access Sinfonia (i.e., reached from its distribution online, or runned locally) and what action you produced. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain **how** you did it. For example, if you reached a page, explain if you reached from direct link, or through clicking a link.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **Include you public BitSong and Osmosis addresses** if you were connected with Keplr.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering:

* **Is it possible to reliably reproduce this issue?** If not, please try to provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which browser are you using?** Please, if it is possible try to provide the exact version of the used browser.
* **Are you using a ledger?** If so, please provide the version of the used ledger.

### How to provide solutions :construction::heavy_plus_sign: 

We love pull requests. Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

#### Getting Started :beginner:

1. Make sure you have a [**GitHub account**](https://github.com/signup/free>).
2. If you want to help in fixing a bug or to propose a solution for an improvement, firstly **check if there exists a related issue**. Otherwise **create a new one following the above documentation**.
3. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
4. **Create a branch** for your edits starting by the `testnet` one.

#### Commit your update :new: 

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. We use conventional commits on our repo, so please, **follow that convention**.

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process :zap:.

#### Pull Request :twisted_rightwards_arrows:

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
1. **Fill the "Pull Request" template** to help the reviewers understanding your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
2. Don't forget to [**link PR to issue**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
3. **Enable the checkbox** to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.

Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
* We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
* As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
